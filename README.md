- The motivation behind this program is to help people save all of their most frequently searched cities weather information in one place.
- The program was built to make it simple for people to check weather in all cities of interest, in one place.
- While building this project I learned about how JavaScript functions work with API's



## Usage

Enter a city of choice - hit SEARCH - view the weather details - and come back later to your saved searches (no limit) for easy access
